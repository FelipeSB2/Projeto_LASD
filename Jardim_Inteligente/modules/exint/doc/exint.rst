EXINT init driver
======================

The External Interrupts are triggered by the INT0 pin or any of the PCINT pins. Observe that, if enabled,
the interrupts will trigger even if the INT0 or PCINT[27:0] pins are configured as outputs. This feature
provides a way of generating a software interrupt.
